========================== ABOUT ==================================

Hephaestus PC is a Custom PC building site that delivers straight to the user's door.
It uses a simple layout for simplicity and ease of use.

========================== PAGES ==================================

@index.html
Home Page

@read.html
// Products Page
Reads database/storage data from a firebase project and loads the products in the page in a card complete with basic information.
The product card has buttons on the top-left that leads to the delete and edit page for the product.

@write.html
// Add Product Page
Very simple form structure that takes the input and sends it to the database using references to the item and database.

@update.html
// Edit Page
Similar to write with the form but populates the data using the keys stored in the session storage. Combines write and read to update data stored in the database.

@delete.html
// Delete Page
Deletes the reference of the product to the database. Removing it from being read by read.js.

========================= FOLDERS =================================

scss/
Contains all the scss styles to be compiled into styles.css

data/

js/

========================== ISSUES =================================

Known Issues:

1. Login, Settings, Search, Pages are purely style choices. No functionality offered. 
2. There is no content for index.html thus far.
3. The edit functionality is limited in that it only works when the image is replaced to begin with the edit function. 
    After this, the product can be updated like normal.
